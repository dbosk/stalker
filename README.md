# stalker: A utility to follow off-SN updates

People have a tendency of using different services to publish (more or less 
interesting) updates about themselves. The idea is to be able to "subscribe" to 
updates of any type of public data that a person publishes.

The use-case is to follow the updates of interesting people and research groups.  
They usually have a web-page that they update with the information. Then this 
program would poll that web-page regularly and notify the user whenever it 
changes.

Actually, to keep track of publications [dblp](https://dblp.uni-trier.de) 
already provides RSS-feeds for each person indexed. This solves part of the 
problem.
